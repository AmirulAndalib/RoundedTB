## To use
Simply open the application, enter a margin and corner radius (try 2 and 6 to get started with a subtle effect!) then click Apply. To remove the effect, close the application.

 - Works with most other taskbar mods, including [TranslucentTB](https://github.com/TranslucentTB/TranslucentTB)
 - Works with multiple monitors, resolutions and scale factors
 - Uses effectively no resources
 - Doesn't alter or modify system files
 - Doesn't require admin permissions

## Known issues
 - Not compatible with auto-hiding taskbars
 - Rounded corners are not antialiased due to a Windows limitation
 - When using some taskbar mods, changes may not be visible until the start button is clicked

## This is not finished!!
