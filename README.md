## How do I get it?
The easiest way to download RoundedTB is from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9MTFTXSJ9M7F). You can also download the latest release from the Releases tab, unzip it and run `RoundedTB.exe`. Lastly, if you're a madman, just compile it yourself.

## To use
Simply open the application, enter a margin and corner radius (try 2 and 6 to get started with a subtle effect!) then click Apply. To remove the effect, close the application.

 - Works with most other taskbar mods, including [TranslucentTB](https://github.com/TranslucentTB/TranslucentTB)
 - Works with multiple monitors, resolutions and scale factors
 - Uses effectively no resources
 - Doesn't alter or modify system files
 - Doesn't require admin permissions
 - Experimental support for auto-hiding taskbars

## Known issues
 - Auto-hiding taskbars that face another monitor may slide onto that monitor
 - Rounded corners are not antialiased due to a Windows limitation
 - When using some taskbar mods, changes may not be visible until the start button is clicked
 - Adding new monitors whilst RTB is running may make Explorer unhappy

## This is not finished!!
If anything breaks, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Esc</kbd> to open Task Manager, end RoundedTB and then restart Explorer. Feel free to let me know by filing an issue and I can look into it.
